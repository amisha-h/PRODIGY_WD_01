# PRODIGY_WD_01
For my internship task, I developed a responsive landing page with a fixed-position navigation menu that changes style when scrolling or when hovering over menu items. I used HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. The navigation bar is designed to stay at the top of the page and becomes darker when the user scrolls past a certain point, improving visibility and user experience. I implemented smooth scrolling for internal links, allowing users to seamlessly navigate between sections. This project helped me improve my skills in responsive design using flexbox, and I gained hands-on experience with interactive elements like hover effects and scroll event listeners.
